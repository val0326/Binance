# The goal of the project is to create a simulator application that partially reproduces and copies trading on an existing exchange. The purpose of such an application is to allow the player to practice trading without financial losses. In any convenient case for trading virtual money, the change in quotes is carried out in a similar way as it is carried out on the exchange.
